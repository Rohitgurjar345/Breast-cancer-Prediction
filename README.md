🧠 Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning<br>
This project is a machine learning model built with Python and Scikit-learn that classifies whether a breast cancer tumor is Malignant (cancerous) or Benign (non-cancerous) using real-world medical data from the UCI Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.<br>

🔍 Overview<br>
✅ Dataset: Built-in breast cancer dataset from sklearn.datasets<br>
⚙️ Model Used: Logistic Regression<br>
📊 Evaluation Metric: Accuracy score<br>
🧪 Test Accuracy Achieved: ~94.7%<br>

🧠 Goal: Build a predictive system that helps in early detection of breast cancer using machine learning.<br>

📁 Project Structure<br>
Data Processing: Loads the dataset, explores and visualizes data, checks for missing values.<br>
Model Training: Trains a logistic regression model on 80% of the data.<br>
Evaluation: Tests the model on the remaining 20% and prints accuracy scores<br>
Prediction System: Allows prediction of cancer type based on custom feature input.<br>

🧪 Sample Prediction<br>
The script includes a sample feature input to test the model. It will print whether the input represents a Malignant or Benign tumor.<br>

📌 Dependencies<br>
numpy<br>
pandas<br>
scikit-learn<br>

The dataset used to test the model is taken form the csv file privided .<br>
